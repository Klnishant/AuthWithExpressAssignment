# Full-Stack User Authentication App

This is a full-stack web application that demonstrates user registration, login, and authentication. It includes both front-end and back-end components and utilizes technologies such as HTML, CSS, Express.js, and MongoDB.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

- MongoDB: Install and run MongoDB locally. You can download MongoDB Community Server from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/full-stack-auth-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd full-stack-auth-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies for both the server and the client:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following content:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/authapp
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```

   Replace `your-secret-key` with your own secret key for JWT token generation.

### Running the Application

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

   The server will run on the port specified in the `.env` file (default: 3000).

2. Open a new terminal window and start the client:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

   The client application will open in your default web browser.

## Usage

### Sign Up

1. Open the web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

2. Fill out the sign-up form with your details, including name, username, email, password, and bio.

3. Click the "Sign Up" button.

### Login

1. After signing up, you'll be redirected to the login page.

2. Enter your username and password.

3. Click the "Login" button.

### User Page

1. Upon successful login, you'll be redirected to the user page.

2. The user's data, including name, username, email, and bio, will be displayed on this page.

### Protecting Routes

Certain routes, like the user page, are protected and require authentication. Attempting to access them without a valid login will result in an unauthorized error.
